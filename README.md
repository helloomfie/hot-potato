# Hot Potato Task Transfer Game

## What this is
A lightweight “game mechanic” concept for transferring tasks between coworkers using a **Hot Potato** rule-set.

The core idea: a task is the “potato.” Whoever holds it is responsible for moving it forward until they either complete it or pass it (with a clear handoff) to the next person.

> Note: I originally believed I was being asked to do this for work, so I started. Later I was told it wasn’t confirmed, so I stopped and left it unfinished.
